# Abstract
Due to the ever growing industry of E-Commerce, there is no end to the necessity of having as many E-Commerce platforms as possible.
Regarding this, we are going to work on an Online Shopping Website branded E-Nexus. It would cover all the basics of a well organized
Online Shopping Website. Being a web based project, it will be built using Html, PHP and MySQL database and deliver a full blown 
Friendly User Interface for consumers to interact with and provide the basic, essential household items. The original idea is to make an
website that would focus on providing our clients with the facility to shop online without having to pay a hefty amount of shipment fee.
Moreover, since it is going to be an original project, we would have its sole ownership and we aim to turn it into a fully functioning
business platform for us in the upcoming future.
